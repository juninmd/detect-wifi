*   **Medium Priority:**
    *   ⏰ **Time-Based Rules:** Schedule notification suppression (e.g., "Don't notify departure between 8 AM - 6 PM").
    *   💾 **Room Database Migration:** Migrate from SharedPreferences to Room for robust history and device management.

### Q3 2026: Intelligence & Context
*Focus: Smarter detection and device understanding.*

*   **High Priority:**
    *   🧠 **Machine Learning Patterns:** Local ML model to learn user routines and suppress false alarms.
*   **Medium Priority:**
    *   🏷️ **Smart Device Categorization:** Automatically categorize devices (Phone, Watch, Laptop, Earbuds) based on MAC OUI and Bluetooth class.
    *   📍 **Multi-Location Support:** Profiles for different locations (Home, Office).
    *   🛡️ **Advanced Anti-Theft:** Trigger alarms based on specific BLE device absence (e.g., "Keys Left Behind").

### Q4 2026: Ecosystem Expansion
*Focus: New platforms and remote access.*

*   **Medium Priority:**
    *   🖥️ **Web Dashboard:** Local HTTP server for status viewing from a browser.
    *   ⌚ **Wear OS Companion:** Watch app for quick controls and wrist-based alerts.
*   **Low Priority:**
    *   🌐 **Internationalization:** Complete translations for ES, FR, DE, PT-BR.

## 4. Feature Details

### UI/UX Polish (Q1)
**User Value Proposition:**
Provides immediate visual feedback to user actions, making the app feel more responsive and polished.
**Technical Approach:**
*   **Feedback:** Add `Toast` messages upon manual refresh trigger.
*   **Visuals:** Implement a rotation animation for the refresh icon during scanning.
*   **Success Criteria:** User receives instant feedback on refresh; scanning animation indicates background activity.
*   **Estimated Effort:** Small (2-3 days)

### Device Management (Q1)
**User Value Proposition:**
Helps users quickly find important devices in crowded networks by keeping labeled devices at the top.
**Technical Approach:**
*   **Sorting Logic:** Implement a custom `Comparator` in `WifiAdapter` prioritizing `nickname != null`.
*   **Persistence:** Store sort preference in SharedPreferences.
*   **Success Criteria:** Labeled devices appear at the top of the list when sorting is enabled.
*   **Estimated Effort:** Small (3-5 days)

### Bluetooth Visualization (Q1)
**User Value Proposition:**
Clarifies *how* a device was detected (WiFi vs. Bluetooth), increasing user confidence in the dual-tech system.
**Technical Approach:**
*   **UI Update:** Add source icons (WiFi/Bluetooth) to list items.
*   **Real-time Data:** Display BLE signal strength (RSSI) with color-coded indicators (Green/Yellow/Red).
*   **Success Criteria:** Users can instantly distinguish between WiFi-connected devices and BLE-detected devices.
*   **Estimated Effort:** Medium (1 week)

### Notification Channels (Q2)
**User Value Proposition:**
Gives users control over which events trigger sounds/vibrations. E.g., Silent for "Arrival", Loud for "Security Alert".
**Technical Approach:**
*   **Channels:** Define specific Notification Channels in `NotificationManager`.
*   **Migration:** Update notification builder logic to use new channel IDs.
*   **Success Criteria:** Users can customize notification settings per category in Android Settings.
*   **Estimated Effort:** Medium (1-2 weeks)

### MQTT Integration (Q2)
**User Value Proposition:**
Enables powerful home automation scenarios (lights, locks) based on presence.
**Technical Approach:**
*   **Library:** Integrate Paho MQTT Android Client.
*   **Configuration:** Create settings UI for Broker URL, Port, Auth.
*   **Logic:** Publish JSON payloads on presence change events.
*   **Success Criteria:** Successful connection to local broker; reliable message publishing.
*   **Estimated Effort:** Medium (2-3 weeks)

### Time-Based Rules (Q2)
**User Value Proposition:**
Reduces annoyance by silencing routine notifications during specific hours (e.g., work hours or sleep time).
**Technical Approach:**
*   **Settings UI:** Time picker for "Quiet Hours" or "Active Hours".
*   **Logic:** Check current time against schedule before triggering notification service.
*   **Success Criteria:** Notifications are suppressed during configured windows but logged in history.
*   **Estimated Effort:** Medium (1 week)

## 5. Dependencies & Risks

*   **Android Background Restrictions:** Future Android versions may restrict background processes further.
    *   *Mitigation:* Continuously monitor Android APIs and adapt Foreground Service types.
*   **Bluetooth Permissions:** Permission complexity increases with Android versions (Scan vs Connect).
    *   *Mitigation:* Maintain robust permission handling logic and educate users via UI prompts.
*   **Battery Impact:** Continuous dual scanning and MQTT can drain battery.
    *   *Mitigation:* Implement "Eco Mode" and user-configurable update intervals.
*   **Hardware Variability:** Bluetooth/WiFi performance varies across devices.
    *   *Mitigation:* Maintain a device compatibility list and allow sensitivity adjustments.
