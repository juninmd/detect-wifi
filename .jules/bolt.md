## 2024-05-23 - History Loading Bottleneck **Learning:** Storing event logs as `Set<String>` in `SharedPreferences` forces a full O(N log N) sort operation on every read to restore chronological order, as Sets are unordered. This becomes a significant main-thread bottleneck as history grows. **Action:** For future, consider migrating high-volume time-series data to Room Database or a flat file with append-only structure to avoid deserialization and sorting costs on every read. For now, offloading to `Dispatchers.IO` mitigates the UI freeze.
